# Large Scale Structe - Final Project
**Here are the final project for the discipline in the LSS-2019.02**
**To run the Shell script use**

`chmod +x get_data.sh`
`./get_data.sh`

We analyse the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Survey (BOSS) data release (DR12). Through ,we will
analyze the North and South BOSS galaxy maps, where galaxies in this work start with z = 0.5 and
go to z = 0.75. Using the Î› cdm model with no curvature, and calculate the power spectrum from
this data. From the power spectrum estimate the uncertainties of the measurements, and for this
we use a covariance matrix not just to estimate the uncertainties but to calculate the correlation
between different data points.Soon after we will retrieve the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
from the power spectrum. Finally we will do a MCMC to retrieve cosmological information.
